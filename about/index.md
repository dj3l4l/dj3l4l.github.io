## The Purpose of this Blog

This blog is a place for me to share fascinating insights on past and present breakthroughs in applied mathematics. It is also a place for me to share the projects that I create; designed to illustrate the value (and I hope, the joy) of those breakthroughs and insights.

If a person comes away from this blog thinking, "wow, that *is* interesting, I never thought of it that way", then it will have achieved what I dreamed for it to do.
