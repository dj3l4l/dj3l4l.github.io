## The Purpose of this Blog

This blog is a place for me to share fascinating insights on past and present breakthroughs in applied mathematics and probability theory. It is also a place for me to share the projects that I create; designed to illustrate the value (and I hope, the joy) of those breakthroughs and insights.

If a person comes away from this blog thinking, "wow, that *is* interesting, I never thought of it that way", then it will have achieved what I dreamed for it to do.

## A Brief Rundown of My Technical Achievements

In 2011, I received an MSci in Astronomy and Physics from UCL. My Masters thesis was on "Black Hole Thermodynamics and the Information Loss Paradox", and my advisor was [Prof. Ian Ford](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/professor-ian-ford).

I then went on to obtain a PhD in the Physics of Astronomical Detectors from the [Quantum Sensors Group](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/research/research-groups/qs) at the Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge. My PhD advisor was [Prof. Stafford Withington](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/directory/withingtons), and my thesis was  titled "Thermal Transport and Noise in Micro-Engineered Support Structures for Detector Applications": an investigation in [novel methods for the accurate simulation of heat transport](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4893019), and for the utilisation of phase-coherent thermal waves to create low-dimensional "heat interferometers". The application of this form of heat interferometry was [proven empirically (for the first time)](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5041348) to reduce noise in superconducting detectors.

I graduated from Cambridge in 2016, and went on to co-found an augmented reality startup, called [Sention](https://www.linkedin.com/company/21145650/admin/), with my good friend [Alexander Bridi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zanbridi/). Whilst at Sention, I researched and developed novel solutions to a broad range of computer vision problems: from pixel-accurate background/foreground removal in natural scenes, to projection-invariant feature discovery, to blind real-time lens distortion correction (to state just a few). All research and algorithms from my time at Sention were proprietary.
