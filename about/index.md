## The Purpose of this Blog

This blog is a place for me to share fascinating insights on past and present breakthroughs in applied mathematics. It is also a place for me to share the projects that I create; designed to illustrate the value (and I hope, the joy) of those breakthroughs and insights.

If a person comes away from this blog thinking, "wow, that *is* interesting, I never thought of it that way", then it will have achieved what I dreamed for it to do.

## A Little About Me

In 2011, I received an MSci in Astronomy and Physics from UCL. My Masters thesis was on "Black Hole Thermodynamics and the Information Loss Paradox", and my advisor was [Prof. Ian Ford](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/professor-ian-ford).

I then went on to obtain a PhD in the Physics of Astronomical Detectors from the [Quantum Sensors Group](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/research/research-groups/qs) at the Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge. My PhD advisor was [Prof. Stafford Withington](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/directory/withingtons), and my thesis was  titled "Thermal Transport and Noise in Micro-Engineered Support Structures for Detector Applications": an investigation in [novel methods for the accurate simulation of heat transport](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4893019), and for the utilisation of phase-coherent thermal waves to create low-dimensional "heat interferometers". The application of this form of heat interferometry was [proven empirically (for the first time)](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5041348) to reduce noise in superconducting detectors.

I graduated from Cambridge in 2016, and went on to co-found an augmented reality startup, called [Sention](https://www.linkedin.com/company/21145650/admin/), with my good friend [Alexander Bridi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zanbridi/). Whilst at Sention, I researched and developed novel and innovative solutions to a broad range of unsolved computer vision problems: from 100% pixel-accurate real-time video segmentation, to 3D scene reconstruction from under-constrained single-camera views, to blind real-time lens distortion correction (to state just a few). All research and algorithms from my time at Sention were proprietary.

My interests are broad, and to list them all would be impractical. The following are the subset of interests that I pursue actively in my current research: Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Probability and Information Theory, Graph Theory and Applied Mathematics.
